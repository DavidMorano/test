# NODE (sample NODEDB file)

#
# Format of entries:
#
# 	node:cluster:system:key=value,...
#
# where:
#
# 'node'	is a nodename 
#
# 'cluster'	is the primary cluster that the node belongs to (other
#		clusters for the same node can be specified in the
#		'cluster' database)
#
# 'system'	is the system that the node belongs to
#
# 'key=value'	arbitrary key=value pairs (separated by a comma) can be 
#		specified for this node
#
#
# Notes:
# In general, one or more nodes belong to clusters.  One or more clusters 
# belong to systems.  And there is no particular name that describes
# what two or more systems make up! :-)  Clusters are defined by the
# member nodes sharing one or more filesystem spaces.  Separate clusters
# do not have to share any filesystem spaces (although they may) in
# order to belong to the same system.  Clusters are therefor a group of
# fairly tightly coupled nodes, while systems are a fairly loosely coupled
# set of clusters.  Systems are (generally) supposed to survive the 
# loss of one or more clusters and still provide some level of basic
# service (through synchronized filesystem space or other methods) while
# clusters are not necessarily expected to survive the loss of one of
# its nodes.  But mileage varies greatly in real-world data centers!
