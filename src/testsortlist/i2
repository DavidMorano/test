This document describes an experimental bus interface integrated circuit
which specifically addresses many of the needs and problems
of very high data rate buses.
The integrated circuit includes a new differential
bus driver circuit which directly addresses problems with
employing differentially driven signals in a bus application
where only one bus master can be driving the bus at a time.
The 3.3 volt 0.5 micron chip provides conversions from TTL and PECL
to $ ddl $ as well
as $ ddl $ to TTL and PECL. There is also a clock doubler, clock divider
and registered versions of the PECL to $ ddl $ and the $ ddl $ to PECL.

.H 1 "Introduction"
.P
The use of differential buses has not been very popular to date in
the low and medium performance computer industry.
The principle factor discouraging the use of differential buses
is the fact that twice as many backplane traces
(and possibly backplane/board connector pins) must be provided
as compared with a backplane bus with only single ended signals.
.P
Backplane buses which have ventured into using differentially driven
signals have usually chosen to use convention ECL voltage swings.
Buses driven differentially with ECL do not enjoy a
particular power savings advantage over TTL flavored buses since
the total voltage swing of a differentially driven ECL bus is
1.4 to 1.8 Volts or more and thus not very much smaller than some single ended
bus applications.
.P
The bus driver used in this integrated circuit is the
first CMOS only technology to implement the new
logic family called \fIDave's Differential
Logic\fP (or $ ddl $).  This $ ddl $ interface logic is
described more fully in "A New Differential Bus Scheme."\*(Rf

This new interface logic solves a number of
problems related to high speed buses for telecommunications applications.

based switching systems.
The ASI is designed to solve many of the limitations of previous
telecommunications buses while achieving a new level of bandwidth
performance.  Prior work on implementing $ ddl $ in a BiCMOS technology

.H 1 "The $ ddl $ Driver Interface Circuit"
.P
The $ ddl $ interface circuit must satisfy one principle requirement.
The interface circuit must either be isolated from the bus in one
logic state or actively driving both leads of a differential bus signal
in the other logic state.  Many circuit designs are possible depending
on system level requirements.
The authors are primarily interested in applications using a lower
total signal voltage swing than conventional ECL differential buses.
.P
A target loaded bus odd mode impedance of 25 Ohms matches the system
requirements of ASI.
This is a reasonable value
when a bus is designed for a nominal odd mode characteristic
impedance of 50 Ohms.  
Due to bus loading, the characteristic impedance
is assumed to be lowered to half of the geometric impedance resulting
in a 25 Ohms odd mode impedance for a realistically loaded bus.
A desired total voltage swing of 0.25 Volts has also been selected
as a reasonable experimental value.
For this total voltage swing of 0.25 Volts,
an odd mode wave current of 5 milliAmperes is required.
For a bus application, a current of 10 milliAmperes would be required
to be sourced by the driver since two waves are always propagated in 
both directions on the bus.
.P
Since differentially driven signals can have 
a factor of up to ten times better signal to noise ratio\*(Rf

and Reduced Power Dissipation,"

.RF
\&, it is reasoned that we can afford to compromise this
ratio substantially by not
swinging the signal voltage level as great as conventional 
differential ECL systems.
By using a differential receiver,
one can still receive the signals with a signal to noise ratio of
perhaps three to five times better than a single-ended receiver
but with drivers that are using less power.

.H 2 "Balanced Driver Isolation"
.P
The driver must either drive a logic one state or do nothing.
Isolation of the driver bus outputs is handled 
lead that is part of the input logic, or the isolated condition 
can be obtained
by asserting a logic zero at the input of the driver.
Having a differential state when the bus is idle solves the
unbalanced signal propagation problem inherent in conventional ECL 
buses utilizing tri-state isolation.
.\"_
.H 2 "Wired Logic Function"
.P
A wired differential "or" signal is now attainable.  If every driver
asserts a logic zero, then no drivers are driving the bus (logic zero).
If one
or more drivers assert a logic one then the signal reads back as a logic one.
