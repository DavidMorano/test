TESTMSGQ

This program provides an example of using the UNIX Message Queue IPC facility.

        This program tests the UNIX Message Queue IPC facility that exists in
        newer UNIX-type (or other) OSes that have SYSV type features (this was
        originated on System V). All versions of Solaris have UNIX Message
        Queues and most other UNIXes that have any SYSV features usually also
        have this. Note that some UNIXes, like Sun Solaris 1 (SunOS 4.x) can
        disable these features by not including them in a newly built kernel!
