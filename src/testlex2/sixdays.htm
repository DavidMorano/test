<HTML><H3><FONT COLOR="#7F00D7"><CENTER>Six Arguments for Six Days</CENTER></FONT></H3><HR WIDTH=90% SIZE=5><P>The plain sense of Genesis chapter one is that Almighty God created the  universe and all it contains in a time period of six  ordinary days.  Apparently,  many  Christians do not  appreciate  that  this truth  under girds the Biblical world view. Some have abandoned  it altogether,  and  opted for a "day/age" interpretation  of  Genesis one.  Why  is it Scriptural, as well as theologically  crucial,  to hold   to   the  six  day  position?  To   demonstrate   why,   six considerations follow.</P><P><B>I. Exegesis</B><BR>Consider  Genesis  one at face value. Does  an  exegetical  grounds appear  for concluding that Holy Spirit means something other  than that creation took place in six real days? Even if it were granted that Moses is using  a  poetic  style  under  inspiration, no justification for that view appears in the text. The phrase, "there was  evening  and morning" occurs after each day.  Nothing  in  the context or elsewhere in Scripture would lead one to the notion that other time periods are intended. In Exodus 20:9,11, the six days of creation are mentioned. The Hebrew word for days (yamim, plural for yom,  day) is used there. In all other Biblical passages  where  it appears, the word yamim refers to literal days. (Cf. Genesis  3:17; 5:5,  23;  7:4;  17:12; 21:4; 24:55; Exodus  7:25;  Numbers  28:17; Deuteronomy 16:13, et. al.)</P><P>True,  the  apostle Peter wrote that one day is with  the  Lord  as 1,000  years,  and vice versa (2 Peter 3:8). Should that  axiom  be used to hypothesize that the Lord Jesus may have been in the  grave for  3,000 years? Peter's point is that God is greater than time  - he  might have written with equal veracity that with the Lord,  one second is as a trillion years and vice versa!</P><P>The  words of the gospels and those elsewhere in the New  Testament preclude  the absurdity that our Savior's time in the grave was  an era  of  thousands of years. Even so, the language  and  intent  of Genesis chapter one make void the day/age concept.</P><P>What then   is  the  reason  that  many   feel   constrained   to hermeneutically  force  the  Scriptures  into  a  day/age  mold?  A significant motive arises from the fear of so called science (cf. 1 Timothy 6:20). Ostensibly desiring to not put a stumbling block  in the way of anyone who might be coming to Christ, some have  allowed their  precious  Bible  to  be subjected to  the  judgment  of  the "worldly  wise  man".  More will be  offered  below  regarding  the alleged  scientific  evidence  against six  day  creation.  Let  it suffice  for the moment to affirm that faith has  compromised  with unbelief all too often in this arena. Is it from studying the  Word that  Christians  have arrived at the day/age (or old  gap  theory) views?  Or,  have they retreated from the Goliath  of  the  world's "knowledge",  in  the  attempt  to keep the  counsel  of  God  from appearing foolish in the eyes of men? This compromising has actually hindered the advance of gospel.  The apostolic  gospel  is the command of the  Creator-Redeemer  to  all mankind  to  repent and believe! Its crystal  purity  and  piercing simplicity  do appear foolish...to those who are perishing (1  Cor. 1:18)!  Christ's gospel is not a vapid message from a nebulous  god capable  of  revealing nothing more than a muddled myth  about  the origin  of His world. Why come in fear and trembling to a god  like that? Why believe that a hapless creator will be an exacting judge?</P><P>One further comment in this vein: If we capitulate to human  wisdom regarding  creation,  why  not  regarding  a  truth  such  as   the resurrection?  Perhaps  the  Lord Jesus  did  not  literally  rise, bodily, on the third day. Perhaps this age is a long period of time during which He is "spiritually rising" through His followers in an allegorical way. After all, does not our great human wisdom tell us that people just do not rise from the dead? Of course, God must not have  meant that, even though all four gospels record it  in  plain language! Perhaps we need a day/age theory of the resurrection!</P><P><B>II. The Origin of the Sabbath</B><BR>God "codified" or inscripturated His moral law for man through  His servant Moses. The Lord Jesus summarized that law as "love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, strength, and mind;  and  your neighbor  as yourself" (See context at Matthew 22:37,  Mark  12:30, and Luke 10:27). This moral law has existed since man existed;  its essence is revealed when human history begins. We see Adam and Eve worshipfully communing with and serving God  at the  very first. Marriage is instituted and made holy by God  right at creation. The sanctity of the lives of God's image bearers - the sanctity of human life - is established at the dawn of history (Cf. Genesis  9:6).  The  sabbath  is also  instituted  as  a  perpetual observance (Genesis 2:3).</P><P>In  the  book of Exodus, chapter 20, the Decalog is given  and  the sabbath  is to be remembered because of the example set by  God  at creation.  If all future weeks are patterned after  those  original six  days with their seventh sabbath day, how can it be that  those first seven days were of different duration than all future days?</P><P>God  could  have made His world in any length of time,  for  He  is time's  Creator.  In fact, "time" only has meaning in  the  created world.  God reveals that He chose six days to create the  universe, with  the seventh day as a Sabbath, in order to give His  images  a pattern for their lives in His service.</P><P><B>III. The Origin of Death</B><BR>The Bible presents a cosmos that was pronounced "very good" by  its Maker.  At the future consummation, God says that He will make  all things  new,  and  that there will be no  more  death,  pain,  etc. (Revelation  21:4). Certainly the inference is well justified  that before  the fall of mankind into sin, death did not exist  at  all.</P><P>After  the fall, God keeps his promise: "In the day you eat of  it, you will die!" He curses the serpent, puts enmity between his  seed and the woman's seed, multiplies the woman's pain, curses the  very ground,  which will now bring forth thorns and  thistles,  subjects Adam to toil, and destines man to return to the dust from which  he was taken. (See Genesis 3:14 - 19).</P><P>Paul further instructs on the massive changes which took place when our first parents plunged all humanity, and God's beautiful  world, into  misery:  "...the  creation was  subjected  to  futility...the creation  itself  also  will  be  set  free  from  its  slavery  to corruption...the  whole  creation groans and suffers the  pains  of childbirth together until now..." (See Romans 8:19ff; consider  the "all is vanity" theme of Ecclesiastes).</P><P>Since  death originated with sin, how can a Bible believing  person hold   a  view  of  origins  which  brings  death  into   existence simultaneously with life? The day/age idea was evidently  conceived to   keep  the  basic  fact  of  Divine  creation   intact,   while accommodating  Darwinism. A corollary concept to the day/age  idea, "theistic evolution", developed. It might well be termed  "theistic thanatology".  It is a view of death which presents a  creator  who apparently  loves death as much as life, or who considers death  to be  good.  From  its  very cradle  and  for  eons  thereafter,  the theoretical  world  of  this  god is one  of  savagery  and  doomed mutants. Survival of the fittest is the creation mandate. This  loveless,  primeval  world is  characterized  by  innumerable evolutionary  dead  ends. Creatures struggle to stay alive  at  the expense  of  other creatures. This is a doctrine of  origins  which normalizes and dignifies the horrors of death and misery. It  makes the  cursed  order of this present fallen  world  indistinguishable from  the order of the "very good" world, wherein was Eden and  its bliss. According to Scripture, death and misery entered by sin.</P><P>The  covenantal  structure of God's redemption places Adam  as  the "federal  head"  of the fallen human race, dead in  trespasses  and sins. The Lord Jesus is the federal head of the redeemed, alive  in Him.  Covenant  theology  is  discredited  by  theistic  evolution, because  it  subverts the doctrine of original sin. It is  in  Adam that  all  die. We do not die simply because  "death  is  natural". Death  is  fundamentally unnatural! Most  day/agers  have  retained their belief in a literal Adam. They would agree that any  doctrine of  man  which denies a literal Adam is a  foundation  for  another gospel.  Any doctrine of death which gives it an origin other  than by sin is also erroneous and dangerous. A Scriptural view of  death sees  it as God's drastic judgment on the sinners who  defiled  the very good world He had made.</P><P>It  is probable that death even for the lower  creation  originated with  the  sin of the higher. Perhaps the garments of  animal  skin given to Adam and Eve, to cover their nakedness (Genesis  3:11,21), also graphically portrayed death to their newly opened eyes. Perhaps the slaughter these garments would have required was  their first  encounter  with physical death. Also, note that it  is  only after the fall that God gives animal flesh as food for man.  Before the  fall, both man and beasts were given "green plants and  fruit" as  food  (Compare  Genesis 1:29,30 with 9:3).  Of  course,  animal sacrifices  were  not made until after sin was in  the  world  (See Genesis 4:3ff). Admittedly, some challenges exist for this thorough going view of the curse: Does the use of green plants and fruit  as food  mean that death existed in the vegetable kingdom before  sin? What  of  those creatures that depend on the decay of  corpses  for their   life?  These  are  not  insurmountable  objections.   Again referring to Genesis 3:14ff, we see that it is sound to infer  that the  curse introduced major physical changes in the created  order, along  with  spiritual devastation. The predator versus  the  prey, thorns  and  thistles,  deformities,  and  perhaps  even  the  very existence of some life forms, is part of the curse, the groaning as Paul says, of the lower creation. It was not so in the beginning!</P><P><B>IV. Creation as General Revelation</B><BR>"The  heavens  declare the glory of God" (Psalm 19:1).  "Since  the creation of the world, His invisible attributes, His eternal  power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through what  has  been  made, so that they are  without  excuse."  (Romans 1:20).  God  points  out to Job the myriad  natural  wonders  which proclaim  His majesty. Other Scripture could be cited to show  that the creation, though cursed, still reveals the Creator.</P><P>Of utmost importance here is that the universe does not merely tell us  that there is "a creator", but it speaks eloquently  about  the Only  True  Creator! It declares the glory of the True God!  It  is man's  blindness  that obscures this natural  revelation,  not  any inarticulateness on God's part! Therefore, the more we  investigate natural  revelation  (and  history),  the more  we  shall  see  the outworking  of what the true and living God has told us in  special revelation (Scripture).</P><P>Consider  the attributes of the "god" of theistic evolution: Is  he all-wise?  He  arrives at finished products through the  trial  and error  method (evolution). In the process, much life is wasted.  Is he a kind and gracious god, who has no pleasure in the death of his creatures? Is this deity fallible and capricious? If so, he is  not the God of the Bible!</P> <P>God's glory is at the heart of this matter! His glorious majesty is maligned  by any view of origins that includes evolution  or  vague "ages of creation", of uncertain duration or purpose!</P><P><B>V. The Witness of Other Scripture</B><BR>All  professing  Christians would agree that Divine creation  is  a major  teaching of the Bible. It is of the very fabric of  the  Old and  New  Testaments.  However, this discussion is  on  a  specific dimension of creation:  God  calling all things into being within a period  of six days. What  can we infer from the following passages about that  specific aspect of God's fiat creation?</P><P>1)  Psalm 148:5 - God commands creatures into existence.  When  the Lord Jesus commanded the winds and waves, instant obedience ensued. When  He changed water into wine, His fellow guests at the  wedding commented  on  the  excellence of the vintage  moments  later.  How unlike  God, and how out of keeping with His ways is the idea  that the mighty Word of His power, which called all out of nothing,  was sluggish in its effect! If anything, an inquirer might dare ask God why  His "ex nihilo" creation required so long a time as six  days! Again,  as per the Ten Commandments statement, God worked six  days and rested one: a model for His people of future weeks.</P><P>2) John 5:45-47 and Luke 16: 29-31. In both of these passages,  the Lord  Jesus evinces an extremely high view of the  Scriptures  that came  through Moses. He says that those who refuse to accept  Moses will  not  believe  Him. If Moses (and the prophets)  will  not  be believed, a resurrection will not convince!</P><P>If  the  Lord so spoke of Moses, who dares assume for  himself  the authority  to despise Moses? Who is wiser than the Lord Jesus?  Has God  allowed His people of all ages to believe in six day  creation but reserved the privilege of a "higher" wisdom for smug, twentieth century gnostics?</P><P>3)  Colossians  1:16 - All things were created  "in  Christ".  This spiritually understood phrase, in Christ, is often used in the  New Testament, and testifies of Christ's Deity (Compare Acts 17:28 - in Him,  that is God, "we live and move and have our  being").  Saints are  said to be in Christ, all things will be summed up  in  Christ (Ephesians  1:10).  That which is in Christ is  acceptable  to  the Father,  is  good, is holy. If all things were created  in  Christ, surely  the  original creation must have been glorious,  holy,  and good - as God declared it to be in Genesis 1:31.</P><P><B>VI. The Witness of Science</B><BR>The  mathematical genius and philosopher Sir Isaac Newton  believed implicitly  in recent, special creation. Likewise did  other  great men  of  science  such as Johann Kepler,  Lord  Kelvin,  and  Louis Pasteur. Real science corroborates God's inerrant, fully  inspired, infallible Word, the Bible.</P><P>The  court of natural science and its expert witnesses is  appealed to last of all, in deference to the Bible. All mere human wisdom is completely subject to His Word. However, when "doing science",  the believer is to take every thought captive to obedience to Christ (2 Corinthians 10:5). He is to reason about nature and investigate it, with the Scriptures as the guiding light for his inquest.</P><P>What  is to be found when examining the "scientific  evidence"  for their  theories offered by theistic evolutionists,  gap  theorists, and day-agers? Among the pieces of evidence offered, a few exhibits that have seemed like formidable giants in the land to God's people are: dinosaurs and their fossil remains; the "geologic column"; the vast light-year distances of interstellar space, carbon 14  dating, and other (radio metric) dating methods.</P><P>A  few  basic  and brief observations are  offered.  Regarding  the dating  methods,  the  amounts of  original  substances  are  often <B>assumed</B>.  Dates are calculated by measuring the rate of  change  of one  substance to another, and comparing the  present amounts  with the <B>assumed</B> original amounts. As for the travel of  light  through space, let us note that it is <B>assumed</B> that light always travels  at the  same speed, and that the light originated at the  far  distant point.  The  "geologic column" is a morass of  circular  reasoning. Fossils  are  dated  by  type of rock and type  of  rock  dated  by fossils.  Anomalous  formations abound,  confounding  expectations. Much is based on naturalistic (godless) <B>assumption</B>.</P> <P>Assumption   is  a  wonderful  tool  for  creative,   investigative postulation,  but  anathema  for proof! True  science  begins  with hypothesis, but does not conclude with it.</P><P>The  dinosaurs  and their extinction present no threat to  six  day creation,  nor to the account of Noah and the ark. (To discuss  the latter  is outside the scope of this paper). Dinosaurs  are  merely animals  which are now apparently extinct. Modern times have  seen, and  continue to see other created kinds become extinct.  In  fact, extinction  itself is more evidence of the current fallen state  of the  world!  It is unfortunate that the "ancient  serpent,  who  is called the devil and Satan" (Revelation 12:9) has caused the  bones of the "terrible lizards" to be a stumbling block. There is no fact pertaining  to  those amazing beasts or their fossil  remains  that conflicts with any Biblical statement.</P><P>Even  as  the  apostle  Peter  prophesied  that  they  would,   men conveniently forget the Great Flood. (See 2 Peter 3:5,6). The  fact is that even to this day, stupendous evidence remains of that great universal  cataclysm.  Much paleontological (fossil)  data  can  be explained   far  more  reasonably  by  "flood  geology"   than   by uniformitarian   geology.  (Uniformitarianism  assumes   that   the features  of  the  earth's crust are best explained  by  forces  of nature  similar to those observable today, acting over  vast  ages. Example:  the  Grand  Canyon was formed by  millions  of  years  of erosion by the Colorado river.)</P> <P>The  Noahic deluge was a world-wide event which surely changed  the face  of the earth fundamentally. Many fossils exist in  "beds"  of huge  proportions,  indicating sudden, mass loss of  life  for  the creatures  preserved.  The  fossil fuels  themselves  are  likewise evidence of the Great Flood of Noah's time.</P><P>These  scientific considerations are but a meager  introduction  to the great weight of real evidence supporting a very young  universe formed  by special creation. By digging deeper into  this  subject, the  Christian reader will be delightfully surprised,  and  greatly built up in the faith once for all delivered to the saints.</P><P>Evolutionary/uniformitarian  dogma  is the current version  of  the perennial  pagan  ideas  of the eternity of matter,  and  of  order arising mysteriously out of chaos. Genesis chapter one,  understood in  its  plain sense, remains unsullied by the folly of  those  who would  gainsay  it. Fashionable alternate theories on  origins  are ever  springing up, and some in Christendom exhaust  themselves  to keep  their theology in vogue. Again and again, these  speculations wither into irrelevance; with all other chaff they blow away.</P> <P>The  Bible believing Christian can rest in knowing his God  created the  universe and all therein,  in six ordinary days. This  bedrock foundation of orthodoxy abides; it is God-breathed truth.</P><CENTER>Keith Graham, May 1996 (original article November 1993)</P><P>Go to <A HREF="http://members.aol.com/lc9967707/index.html"> Locktown Presbyterian Church</A><BR><B>http://members.aol.com/lc9967707/</B><P><P>Or...</P><P>Go to <A HREF="http://members.aol.com/deux/index.html"> Pastor Graham's Teaching Page</A><BR><B>http://members.aol.com/deux/</B></CENTER></HTML>
