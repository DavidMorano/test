TESTCOMSAT

This little program is an Internet COMSAT test server (for UDP).

This is some sort of hack server, created from some previous hack server. Care
should be exercised before using. And the code should be looked through to make
sure that any assumptions are valid.

-u <user>	username to use
-mo <off>	offset to use
