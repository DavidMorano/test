CONFIGVARS


We collect all 'define's from all files and collapse like-names
into one with colon (':') separators.

We collect all 'unset's but do not collapse them.  We discard
duplicates since we only need one to be effective.  These will unset
exported variables that are already being exported before any of the
newly exported variables in the configuration file are added to the
export variable list.

We collect all 'set's and free variables similarly (but stored
separately).  These will not be collapsed.

When a variable is read by the program, the following will occur :

1) all variables will be returned (in turn)

2) each variable value will be processed to substitute in -
	a) define'd variables ; file dependencies are recorded
	b) environment variables in the current program space
	c) the special escapes

4) variable values are shell-parsed series of arguments ; no attempt
   will be made to separate or process those arguments individually ;
   this is consistent with the handling of shell-parsed arguments in
   server table files

5) a copy of a processed variable and its value is cached
   for use later

6) when any file changes, any variable that had a dependency on that
   file is flushed from the post-processed cache


The following keywords are recognized as special :

root
nodename
domainname
hostname
version

Only the last of any of these is retained as the value.  They are
substituted for from previous information at the time they are
processed.  They are processed before all other variables.
