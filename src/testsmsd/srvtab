# SRVTAB
# TCPMUXD service table
#
#	The format of entries are (example) :
#
#	service:
#		program= /usr/bin/prog,
#		args=	arg0 arg1,
#		user=	uucp,
#		group=	other,
#		opts=	options
#		groups=	"other, www",
#		access= "name1 name2 group1 ,group2"
#
#
#

#	The following substitutions are made on keyword value strings :
#
#		%V	TCPMUXD version string
#		%S	program "search" name
#		%R	TCPMUXD program root
#		%N	nodename
#		%D	domainname
#		%H	hostname
#		%U	running under this username

#		%P	socket peername (if available)
#		%I	IDENT information (if available)

#

#	The following variable substitutions are also made :
#
#		${define}	substituted defines
#		${environment}	substituted environment variable
#

#
#	There are some built-in servers on some of the listener daemon
#	programs.  Some of these are listed below.  These internal
#	servers can be overridden by making an entry with the same
#	service name in this file.
