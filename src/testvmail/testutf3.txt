    * The revolutionary myComputer app searches the content from 13 top

      divides that peer-reviewed, authoritative information into topic
      areas for easy discovery
    * You purchase token packets – $45 for 24 tokens (IEEE Computer Society
      members get 36) – and for each token, you can download in HTML the
      full content of an article essential to you – instantly
    * Everyone gets 4 tokens free so you can try it out
    * Get the answers you need from vetted, authoritative sources in
      seconds

It’s a small investment to try out what may be the biggest thing in 
technology information delivery – ever. Download the myComputer app HERE
