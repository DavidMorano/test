NOTES (ISSUE)

Files in this directory are used for creating the "issue" statement
when a (usually login) connect request arrives to the host.

Files to be used in creating the "issue" are of the form:

<key>.issue

where '<key>' is a profile-key that is associated with a certain access
point to the host.  These keys may be named anything and the machine
administrator assigns what keys are played out to what interface access
points to the host.

Generally, at least one key-file should be present named 'default.issue'
for most administrative setups.

Multiple files with the same key is possible when the files are named with
successively higher decimal digits following the key name.  For example:

default0.issue
default1.issue

will both be played out when a connect request comes active associated
with the key-name 'default'.  Multiple files with the same key-name are
played out in ascending order (with the non-digit version played out
first, if present).

If a file for a given key-name is not found, files with the key 'default"
are played out instead.  Further, regardless of any key-name given,
any files with the pseudo key-name of 'all' are also played out.
