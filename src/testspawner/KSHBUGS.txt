KSHBUGS

The KSH shell program will cause certain programs that it tries
to execute to appear to fail (it *will* fail to the user) because
the KSH program messes something up in the process.

By experimentation, the path component "/usr/dt/bin" must be
included in the program-execution search path ("PATH") at the
time the execution is attempted.
