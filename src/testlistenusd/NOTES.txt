The server listens on (for now) a local UNIX domain socket (DGRAM).
This server just provides an "echo" service and just echos back
to the originator whatever it receives (if the originator
provides a return address).



Other ideas for how to structure a local (UNIX domain) server might
include using a service code as the first two bytes of the message to
distinguish different services desired.  Some ideas are presented
below.

Service codes are :

0		reserved
1		notice
2		random
