        This subroutine was adapted from an old version that was used in the old
        days at AT&T Bell Laboratores (known as Bell Telephone Laboratories back
        then). In those days, processors did not have native hardware support
        (or "good" native hardware support) for 64-bit (or sometimes not even
        32-bit) division.

/*******************************************************************************

        The 'convdec()' subroutine converts the unsigned long (64-bit) integer
        "lval" to printable decimal and places it in a buffer identified as
        relative to 'endptr' (a pointer to a char buffer). The value returned is
        the address of the first non-zero character.

        Short of assembly language magical smart stuff (which I have coded
        elsewhere), this implementation of decimal conversion should be among
        the fastest (despite its simplicity).

	Synopsis:

	char *convdecu(lval,endptr)
	ULONG		lval ;
	char		*endptr ;

	Arguments:

	lval		value (unsigned) to be converted
	endptr		pointer to one byte beyond the end of a result buffer
	
	Returns:

	-		pointer to start of convered string
	
	Implementation note:

        We develop the decimal digits in two stages. Since speed counts here we
        do it in two loops. The first loop gets "lval" ("long value") down until
        it is no larger than INT_MAX. The second loop uses integer divides
        rather than long divides to speed it up.

        Also note that we do not use *both* a division and a modulus operation
        to develop the digits (as some people do). Instead we use a single
        division and a multiplication to develop the digits. If we did this in
        assembly language on some architectures we could get a division and a
        modulus result with a single combined division-modulus instruction. But
        in C language (a high-level language) we do not have this luxury, unless
        a compiler is super smart and can somehow figure out that a single
        devision-modulus instruction can provide both results at different
        points in a a loop but each using the same operands. Some compilers have
        claimed to be able to do this, but in general we do not want to rely on
        that (rather remote) possibility here.

        Of course, we assume that doing both a single division and a
        multiplication operation per loop iteration is over all faster than
        doing both a division and a modulus operation per loop iteration. This
        seems to be a reasonable assumption. On platform architectures that do
        not have a good hardware division instruction (performance), this can be
        a huge win.
