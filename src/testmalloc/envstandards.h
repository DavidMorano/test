	I had to f*ck-sh*t with the preprocessor define named 
	'_XOPEN_SOURCE'. See below.

/****
On (f*ck-sh*t) Darwin OS, one must define the preprocessor symbol
'_ANSI_SOURCE' in order to get the declaration for the kernel
subroutine |waitid(2)|.  But if we do so (on f*ck-sh*t Darwin)
we get all hell breaking loose with many other declarions being
missing (for whatever f*ck-sh*t reason). So we instead are
careful top NOT define that preprocessior sysmbol. 
Long live f*ck-sh*t Darwin OS!
Oh, and thanks so much for making me take hours to figure out
how this f*ck-sh*t works on Darwin.

On (f*ck-sh*t) Darwin OS, if we define the preprocessor symbol

careful to NOT define with any sort of value.
