EGD notes



 ways to get at the entropy:
  easiest is a unix or tcp socket, with a message protocol to say how much you
   want and to be told how much you are going to get
  next up is a named pipe
 ways to query/control:
  socket, messages
  socket, guile interpreter (silly..)
 try all entropy sources. if they cause errors, drop them from the list.
 message format:
 0x00 (get entropy level)
  0xMM (msb) 0xmm 0xll 0xLL (lsb)
 0x01 (read entropy nonblocking) 0xNN (bytes requested)
  0xMM (bytes granted) MM bytes
 0x02 (read entropy blocking) 0xNN (bytes desired)
  [block] NN bytes
 0x03 (write entropy) 0xMM 0xLL (bits of entropy) 0xNN (bytes of data) NN bytes
 0x04 (report PID)
  0xMM (length of PID string, not null-terminated) MM chars
