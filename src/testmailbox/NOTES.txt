MAILBOX

These are notes on the MAILBOX object.


= Usage restrictions

It is assumed that the mailbox file is seekable.  Messages are not saved
while scanning during the "open" so it is expected that the caller will
want to seek back and read the messages herself.


= Future ideas

Semaphore field value:

	version time open_count O-P-R-D

+ version	8-bit integer (1 byte, 2 bytes in HEX)
+ space		1 byte
+ time		32-bit UNIX time (4 bytes, 8 bytes in HEX)
+ space		1 byte
+ open_count	16-bit integer (2 bytes, 4 bytes in HEX)
+ space		1 byte
+ O-P-R-D	old-parsed-read-delete bytes (4 bytes allocated)

bytes total	21

O	old
P	parsed
R	read
D	deleted
